# Marble-Track-Forest-Savana
 Welcome to the Marble Track Project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a mesmerizing marble track inspired by forests and the African Savanna. The project incorporates both electrical and mechanical mechanisms to create an immersive experience.

# Project Overview
 The Marble Track Project aims to build a fully functional marble track that consists of four distinct phases: lifting, color sorting, shooting, and collection. Each phase is carefully designed and integrated with the picturesque forest view.

# Lifting Mechanism
 The lifting mechanism in this project is ingeniously realized using a rotating disk. This disk efficiently elevates the marbles, setting them on their exciting journey through the track.

# Color Sorting Mechanism
 To add an interactive element, a color sorting mechanism has been implemented. This mechanism guides the marbles along specific paths based on their colors. It ensures that each colored ball follows the designated track, enhancing the visual appeal and providing an element of surprise.

# Shooting Mechanisms
 The project features two shooting mechanisms represented by catapults. These catapults skillfully launch the marbles towards two funnels. The precision and timing of the launches add excitement and anticipation to the marble's trajectory.

# Collection
 All the marbles from the shooting mechanisms ultimately converge on a single track, leading them to a reservoir. This collection phase gathers all the marbles in one place, providing a satisfying culmination to their journey through the track.
